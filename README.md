# Abraxas Engine II
Abraxas Engine is my multi-genre game engine, heavily in development. This used to be written in Java, but decided to rewrite it cause I encountered way too many technical problems.
## Story
Abraxas Engine was originally the name of my CompSci thesis project. It was a platformer written in C# using XNA Framework for rendering. I love the name, Abraxas was the name of the antagonist, so I decided to name the subsequent versions of the engine after it.
## Capabilities
* ~~Right now, it can produce a fairly standard VN, which was the original purpose of this engine.~~ Porting from the Java version
* ~~In February 2025 I ported a Raycasting engine to this code, originally called RayCastMeADream, so it can make a First Person game too. Good shit.~~ Porting from the Java version
# What's working
* ~~Menu~~
* ~~Can advance text on the VN section~~
* ~~Raycaster works and you can navigate the farily simple map~~
* ~~2025/03/23: We've got sounds now!~~
# ToDo
* Port everything from the Java version 

# Development Screenshots
From the Java version, will get replaced as soon as I have something working
